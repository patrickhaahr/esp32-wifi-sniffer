## Security

All communications are encrypted with TLS 1.3:

- **ESP32 → MQTT**: MQTTS on port 8883 with CA certificate verification
- **Web GUI → MQTT**: MQTTS on port 8883 with CA certificate verification  
- **Browser → Web GUI**: HTTPS on port 3000 with self-signed certificate
- **WebSocket**: WSS (secure WebSocket) automatically over HTTPS

## Privacy & GDPR Compliance

This system is designed with privacy in mind:

- **MAC Address Hashing**: All MAC addresses are hashed using SHA-256 on the ESP32 before transmission
- **No PII Storage**: Only hashed identifiers are stored and transmitted
- **No Raw Packet Logging**: Raw 802.11 frames are never logged or stored
- **Local Processing**: All data stays within your local network

## Requirements

### Hardware
- 3+ ESP32 development boards (ESP32, ESP32-C3, ESP32-S3, etc.)
- USB cables for flashing and power
- WiFi network for MQTT communication

### Software
- Rust (with ESP32 toolchain)
- Cargo
- espflash or cargo-espflash
- Docker (for MQTT broker, optional)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patrickhaahr/esp-sniffer-rs.git
cd esp-sniffer-rs
```

### 2. Install ESP32 Rust Toolchain

Follow the [esp-rs installation guide](https://docs.esp-rs.org/book/installation/index.html):

```bash
cargo install espup
espup install
. $HOME/export-rs.sh  # Or add to your shell profile
```

### 3. Generate TLS Certificates

**Important**: Set your server IP in `.env` first, then generate certificates:

```bash
# Copy and configure environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your server IP (the machine running MQTT broker and web GUI)
SERVER_IP=192.168.1.100  # Your server's IP address
WIFI_SSID=your_network_name
WIFI_PASS=your_network_password
MQTT_BROKER=mqtts://192.168.1.100:8883  # Note: mqtts:// for TLS
MQTT_USERNAME=elev1  # MQTT authentication username
MQTT_PASSWORD=password  # MQTT authentication password
STATION_ID=station1

# Generate TLS certificates and MQTT password file
./genssl.sh
```

The script creates:
- `certs/ca.crt` - Root CA certificate (for ESP32 clients)
- `certs/server.crt` - Server certificate (shared by MQTT broker and web GUI)
- `certs/server.key` - Server private key
- `mosquitto/config/passwd` - MQTT password file with user credentials

### 4. Start MQTT Broker

Start the included Mosquitto MQTT broker with TLS and authentication:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The broker will listen on port 8883 with TLS encryption and username/password authentication.

### 5. Verify MQTT TLS Connection with Authentication

Test the MQTT broker with TLS and authentication:

```bash
# View all MQTT messages with TLS and authentication
mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.1.100 -p 8883 --cafile ./certs/ca.crt -u elev1 -P password -t '#' -v
```

Replace `192.168.1.100` with your `SERVER_IP`. The credentials (`elev1`/`password`) are configured in your `.env` file.

### 5. Configure Station Positions

Edit `web/config.toml` to match your physical setup:

```toml
[room]
width = 5.0   # Room width in meters
height = 9.0  # Room height in meters

[[stations]]
id = "station1"          # Must match STATION_ID in .env
x = 0.5                  # X position in meters
y = 0.5                  # Y position in meters
label = "Station 1"
rssi_at_1m = -45.0       # Calibration: RSSI at 1 meter
path_loss_exponent = 3.0 # Indoor path loss (2.0-4.0)
```

## Usage

### Flash ESP32 Stations

For each ESP32, update the `STATION_ID` in `.env` and flash:

```bash
cargo fr
```

This command will:
1. Build the firmware in release mode
2. Flash to ESP32
3. Open serial monitor

**Note**: `cargo fr` is a custom alias defined in `.cargo/config.toml` that expands to `cargo run --release --bin esp-sniffer-rs`.


### View Real-time Data

1. Open browser to `https://localhost:3000` (accept self-signed certificate warning)
2. You'll see a 2D visualization of the room with:
   - Station positions (fixed markers)
   - Detected devices (moving circles)
   - Device trails showing movement history
   - RSSI values and signal strength indicators
   - Real-time triangulation positioning

### Monitor MQTT Messages

View device detection data in real-time:

```bash
# Monitor all MQTT topics with TLS
mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.1.100 -p 8883 --cafile ./certs/ca.crt -t '#' -v

# Monitor only device events
mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.1.100 -p 8883 --cafile ./certs/ca.crt -t 'sniffer/+/device' -v
```

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cargo fr` | Flash firmware to ESP32 with serial monitor |
| `cargo br` | Build ESP32 firmware only (release mode) |
| `cargo web` | Run web GUI (cross-platform) |
| `cargo web-l` | Run web GUI (Linux-optimized) |
| `cargo web-m` | Run web GUI (macOS Apple Silicon) |
| `cargo web-w` | Run web GUI (Windows) |

## How It Works

### ESP32 Sniffer

1. **WiFi Promiscuous Mode**: ESP32 enters monitor mode to capture 802.11 management frames
2. **MAC Extraction**: Source MAC addresses are extracted from probe requests and data frames
3. **Privacy Hashing**: MAC addresses are hashed with SHA-256 immediately
4. **RSSI Measurement**: Signal strength (RSSI) is recorded for each frame
5. **MQTT Publishing**: Hashed MAC + RSSI + timestamp sent to MQTT broker

### Trilateration Algorithm

The web dashboard uses advanced positioning:

1. **RSSI to Distance**: Converts signal strength to estimated distance using log-distance path loss model:
   ```
   distance = 10^((rssi_at_1m - rssi) / (10 * path_loss_exponent))
   ```

2. **Gradient Descent**: Minimizes position error using weighted non-linear least squares

3. **Position Smoothing**: Exponential moving average reduces jitter in real-time tracking

4. **Fallback**: Uses weighted centroid when fewer than 3 stations detect a device

## Configuration

### ESP32 Sniffer Configuration

Located in `src/sniffer.rs`:

```rust
const SEND_RATE: u32 = 10;  // Send 1 in every 10 packets to MQTT
const CHANNEL_CAPACITY: usize = 32;  // Event queue size
```

### Triangulation Configuration

Located in `web/config.toml` or programmatically:

```toml
[triangulation]
smoothing_factor = 0.4           # 0.0 = no smoothing, 1.0 = no update
max_iterations = 50              # Gradient descent iterations
convergence_threshold = 0.01     # Stop when position change < 0.01m
learning_rate = 0.5              # Gradient descent step size
min_stations = 3                 # Minimum stations for trilateration
max_reading_age_secs = 10        # Ignore readings older than 10s
min_rssi = -90                   # Ignore weak signals
max_distance = 50.0              # Ignore unrealistic distance estimates
```

## Troubleshooting

### ESP32 Connection Issues

```bash
# Check serial port
ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM*

# Flash with verbose output
cargo fr

# Or manually with espflash
espflash flash --release --monitor target/xtensa-esp32-espidf/release/esp-sniffer-rs
```

### MQTT Connection Issues

```bash
# Test MQTT broker with TLS
mosquitto_sub -h <broker-ip> -p 8883 --cafile ./certs/ca.crt -t "sniffer/#" -v

# Check if ESP32 is publishing with TLS
mosquitto_sub -h <broker-ip> -p 8883 --cafile ./certs/ca.crt -t "sniffer/+/device" -v
```

### Certificate Issues

```bash
# Regenerate certificates if needed
./genssl.sh

# Check certificate files
ls -la certs/
# Should show: ca.crt, ca.key, server.crt, server.key

# Verify server certificate
openssl x509 -in certs/server.crt -text -noout
```

### HTTPS Certificate Warnings

The web GUI uses a self-signed certificate. In your browser:
1. Navigate to `https://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"
3. The connection is still encrypted, just not signed by a public CA

### Poor Positioning Accuracy

1. **Calibrate RSSI**: Measure actual RSSI at 1 meter and update `rssi_at_1m`
2. **Adjust Path Loss**: Increase `path_loss_exponent` for environments with more obstacles
3. **Station Placement**: Position stations in a triangle/polygon for best results
4. **Reduce Smoothing**: Lower `smoothing_factor` for faster position updates

### TLS/SSL Issues

1. **Certificate Mismatch**: Ensure `SERVER_IP` in `.env` matches the IP where services run
2. **Port Conflicts**: Make sure port 8883 (MQTT) and 3000 (HTTPS) are available
3. **Firewall**: Allow incoming connections on ports 8883 and 3000
4. **Docker Permissions**: Certificate files should have readable permissions (644)
